# Personal website - Jade Diniz 

This is a site designed for study and challenge and to be used as my personal site for demonstration in interviews and job applications.

Above all, a personal website serves as a window where you can showcase particular skills and connect with a particular target audience. This applies best when it comes to the job market, whether you are looking for a better job or simply considering an alternative career path.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
